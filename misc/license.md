#### 2. License Installation Type

CukeTest supports the installation of **seat licenses** and **concurrent licenses**. seat licenses are available in Pro and Enterprise editions, and concurrent licenses are only available in Enterprise edition.

1. **Concurrent License**

   A.K.A. float license. This type of license is not tied to a specific user. A software product license shared by multiple team members; however, the total number of concurrent users cannot exceed the number of floating licenses purchased. For example, if you purchased one floating license for the CukeTest software product, any user within your company can use the product at any time. If another person wants to access the product and wants to unlock the licensed quota, he must wait for the current user to close the software.

   Specifically, when a user launches the product, the product is configured to point to a license server, a license is checked out to this specific computer that the user uses. When a user exits the the application, the license is released and is available to other users. To use floating licenses, you must obtain floating license keys and install them on the license server. This server responds to end-user requests for access to license keys; it grants access to concurrent users that match the number of licenses purchased by your company.

2. **Seat License**

   This type of license is licensed to a single user and can be activated on a limited number of computers used by that user. Refer to [Install License (Single-User Version)](/misc/license_install.md) to install the single-user license.

#### 3. License Term Type

License may have different term types, including **permanent license** and **term license**:

1. **Permanent License**
   The license is permanent after installation and supports free upgrades. A permenant license also includes first year technical support services.

2. **Term License**
   The license is valid for a certain period of time. After it expires, {{book.product}} will automatically downgrade to the Lite version. We currently offer a one-year term license.

You can purchase combinations of the above types as needed, such as:

1. Single user permanent professional license
2. Single user professional term License
3. Permanent enterprise float License

When no license is installed or license expires, you will be using free Lite version.
